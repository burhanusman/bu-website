  <h1>Machine Learning at Amazon</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">A talk I attended by an ML engineer</p>
  <time datetime=2019-04-06T14:09:17&#43;0530 class="post-date">Sat, Apr 6, 2019</time>
  <p>Recently I attended a talk by Mr Part Gupta, an ML engineer at Amazon. It was
mostly about the Machine Learning use cases at Amazon. The talk was quite
informative as I had attended few courses on Machine Learning and Information
Retrieval. This post is a summary of the talk.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Use Cases @Amazon.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Product Recommendation:</strong> Recommend the <em>right product</em> to the <em>right
customer</em> in the <em>right place</em> at the <em>right time</em>. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Challenges:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  —
<em>Scale</em>: Amazon has hundreds of millions of users. Personalised product
recommendations are to be made to each one of them.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Personalisation</em>:
Product preference may vary greatly across different users.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Real Time:</em>
The recommendations should happen in real-time. This requires that there is low
latency.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Cold-start:</em> This is a problem with any recommender system. How
to recommend a product to a new user (since recommendations usually use a users
past browsing data on the platform). Also, to whom to recommend new products
which are added to the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Product Demand and Forecasting</strong> : Given past sales of a product in every
region, predict regional demand up to one year in future. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> This is important
for Amazon because often they stock-up the inventory at some of the Fulfilment
Centres<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <em>Challenges</em>:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Scale: 20</em>+ million products fulfilled by
Amazon alone.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>New Product</em>: If a new product is added to the platform,
how to predict the demand for it since we don’t have past sales data.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  —
<em>Seasonal</em>: Many products have demands varying with season. How to model
that?!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Demand Spikes</em>: External events might trigger demand spikes which
might not be directly modelled from previous sales data.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Regionalised</em>:
Since the demand for different regions across the world differs drastically, how
to incorporate these variations in the model.</li>
<li><strong>Product Classification</strong>: Given a product description from a seller, map it to
the appropriate product category. Amazon maintains a product category which is
structured as a tree, and final categories lying in one of the leaf nodes.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Challenges: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Scale</em> : Number of product categories are high, more than 1000. Classifying things into these many categories is gonna be a task.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  —
<em>Fuzzy Class definitions</em>: Often the product categories are fuzzy because the
nature of products is so. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Multi-label and Multi-class</em>: Products might
belong to more than one category. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Incorrect/Missing data</em>: The product
description might have some missing values ( like the title). How to deal with
those.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Product Vs Accessories:</em> It’s often hard to distinguish between
the descriptions of a product and some of its accessories.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Training data
quality</em>: Training data may be badly labelled, or often there are few products
in the training data for a particular category.</li>
<li><strong>Product Matching:</strong> Given product information, find duplicate product listings
in the Amazon category. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Challenges:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Scale</em>: The Amazon catalog
contains 100+ million product listings. Looking for duplicates among these
listings is gonna be challenging.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>High precision requirement</em>: It’s very
important that only the <em>same</em> products are listed as on listings. If not a
hell-lot of problems are gonna happen, customer getting the wrong good for
starters.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Incorrect/Missing Data</em>: Again, some of the descriptions might
have missing inputs. The model should take care of these.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Variations</em>:
Products might be subtly different, and they should be listed separately. The
model should be able to take care of these small variations.</li>
<li><strong>Product Search:</strong> This is probably the most important ML task at Amazon. Given
a partial query, find the right product for the right customer, in the right
place at the right time. This statement summarises any Information Retrieval
task.</li>
<li><strong>Ad-Click Probability:</strong> Predict the performance (click-through rates,
conversion rate) of an ad. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Challenges:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Sparsity of the training
data</em>: Ad-Clicks are really rare (How many time do you click on an ad on any web
page ?!). Hence the training data would be imbalanced towards no-clicks.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  —
<em>Latency</em>: The ads are placed according to their relevance and also by factoring
in the real-time bidding that’s happening. Hence the prediction is to be done in
a very short time, every time.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Explore and exploit</em>: The popular
reinforcement learning paradigm is to be used here because the creatives are
changing dynamically and customer interests keep changing.</li>
<li><strong>Information Extraction From Reviews:</strong> Extract product attributes and ratings
from reviews.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Challenges: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <em>— Diverse Product Attributes:</em> Since the
products are diverse, so would the attributes. <em>—Informal Styles of the
comments:</em> Often the comments are written in an informal style making it
difficult to use conventional IR methods<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Short Text</em>: Many of the
comments are really short and extracting useful information might be difficult</li>
<li><strong>Visual Search:</strong> Recognise products in an image and map it to the Amazon
Catalog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Challenges : <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — *Detecting a product from the image:*The image
to be searched would be of any kind, and detecting a specific product in that
image would be challenging. <em>— Wide variety of products in the Amazon category:</em> Sifting through the Amazon catalog containing millions of images is also
challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> With Alexa in the scene, this is a major use case for
Amazon.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Challenges: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Real-Time Recognition:</em> The speech is to be
recognised and responded on the fly.** — *Unconstrained Environment*: Need to
deal with the background noise<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — *Speaker Adaptation*: Adapt and involve
specific to the current user.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — S*peaker Independent*: Generalisability to
new users<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — *Word Error Rate*: Need to decrease the amount mistakes done in
recognition because it impacts user experience</li>
<li><strong>Deal Ranking:</strong> Rank Deals to maximise relevance or revenue* —
Personalisation: *Personalised deals to be offered to users according to their
past buying habits.*— Short-duration:*The deals run for a short time.
Optimisation to be done considering that.</li>
<li><strong>Question and Answering:</strong>  Answer user’s questions in any context — Echo,
Mobile, Desktop, Apps etc<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  — <em>Complexity and Variability of the questions:</em> Open-ended <em>— Source of information:</em> It’s important to choose the right source
of information to answer user queries — especially in the era of fake news!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 
<em>—High Precision and Recall:</em>— Variability in customer-created content:* The
answers would differ from customer to customer, based on their history, buying
habits, wish-lists, reminders etc.</li>
