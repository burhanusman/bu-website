## Logistic Regresion


### Why don't we directly use linear regression

### MLE Estiamte

For more than two classes?


## Linear Discriminant Analysis

### Why LDA apart from Logistic Regression?
1. When classes are well separated, the parameter estimates for the logistic regression are unstable. 
2. If n is small and X is normal for each class, LDA is more stable
3. Popular for more than two classes

Why is it Linear?
Guassian Assumption with shared coovariance across classes
* logistic regression can
outperform LDA if these Gaussian assumptions are not met.


### Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

* Quadratic Boundary - more flexible than LDA
*
