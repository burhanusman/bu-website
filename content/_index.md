## Welcome

Hi there. I'm a data-scientist currently working with a Big-4 consultancy.
I have recently found my passion for data-science and machine learning.
You are welcome to read one of my [blogs](/blog), or check out some
of the things I built under [projects](/projects).





## Education

I have a bachelor's in chemical engineering, and and a master's in Business analytics, from [IIM Calcutta](https://www.iimcal.ac.in/).
I have taken courses in Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, and Deep Learning.
I'm still learning a lot on my own, currently reading about Distributed Systems and Reinforcemnet Learning.
